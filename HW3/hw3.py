#Your resulting tables should have the attributes in the same order as appeared in the sample answers. 

#Make sure to test that python prints out the strings (your username and SQL queries) correctly.

#usage: python hw1.py or python3 hw1.py
# make sure the program prints out your SQL statements correctly. That means the autograder will read you SQL correctly. Running the Python file will not execute your SQL statements (just prints them).
